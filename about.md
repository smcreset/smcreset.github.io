I'm a Christian, a husband, a nerd, and a neurotic over-thinker.  I'm a little (a lot) rough around the edges, but I'm trying.  I have a lot of thoughts on a lot of things, and this website is where you'll hear them.

### Random Stats
  -I have two dogs
  -I always max out charisma
  -I always say I'm going to be a mage or assassin, but I always end up tanking.
  -My wife is far smarter than I am, but for now I've fooled her into thinking I'm good enough for her.
